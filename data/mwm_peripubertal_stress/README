This folder contains the original Morris Water Maze trajectories of rats induced to peri-pubertal stress (PPS). The data was acquired from the Laboratory of Behavioural Genetics, EPFL. For more information about the experiments see Gehhring et al., "Detailed analysis of swimming paths in the Morris Water Maze", Scientific Reports, 2015.

Trajectories were acquired with Ethovision 3.1 and need to be first calibrated (details of the calibration are given in the supplementary information of the referecence given above). A ready to use calibration procedure is given in the import/noldus/calibration directory in the root folder.  

A total of 3 experiments were performed. These are split into three folders: set1, set2, and set3. For information about the IDs of control and stress groups of animals, as well as other experimental details such as arena size and plaform position, please refer to the config/morris_water_maze/config_mwm.m file.
