\section{Introduction}

\indent This software can be used to analyse the trajectories of animals by means of a semi-supervised clustering algorithm.

For more details of the analysis procedure, as applied to trajectories in the Morris Water Maze, please refer to \href{http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14562}{Gehring et al., 2015}. The data used in this article is also provided here as an example application of the code. Although this code was initially applied to trajectories in the Morris Water Maze, the method is general enough as to be applied to other types of experiment.

Please note that this code works only with the specific data provided and for the experimental set up of Morris Water Maze described in the paper. A generalized and updated version is provided \href{https://github.com/RodentDataAnalytics/roda}{here}. The updated version has an improved graphical user interface and a complete description on how the code may be used with user defined experimental setups and data.


\section{Provided Functions}

This software provides the following main functionality:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A graphical user interface (GUI) for browsing and tagging trajectories or segments of trajectories (\textbf{gui$/$browse\_trajectories.m}). A secondary window, from the GUI, providing multiple data visualizations (such as individual feature values and clusters) can be accessed. The GUI can also start the semi-supervised clustering algorithm used to classify similar trajectories or segments;
	
	\item Semi-supervised clustering algorithm (\textbf{semisupervised\_clustering.m}): this class is a front end for the MPCKmeans semi-supervised algorithm. It uses manually labelled data (provided as mapping from trajectory segments to of one or more behavioural classes) to define must-link and cannot-link constraints.
	
	\item Plotting routines for plotting trajectories (\textbf{plot\_trajectory.m}) or the classification results in the form of color bars (one color for each behavioural class) for each trajectory (\textbf{plot\_distribution\_strategies.m});
	
	\item Various other functions for analyzing and validating the clustering results. These functions are inside the \textbf{results$/$mwm} folder and are used to generate the results and figures of the publication referenced above. This publication focuses on the comparison of the behaviour between stressed and non-stressed rats in the Morris Water Maze experiment.
\end{itemize}


\section{Using the Code}
\subsection{Quick Run}

In order to reproduce any of the results of the paper the file \textbf{initialize.m} needs to run. Then, by calling each of the scripts, available in the \textbf{results$/$mwm folder}, the various figures and results of the paper can be generated. For convenience, a script called \textbf{ALL\_RESULTS}, which generates all the results and figures at once, is provided. The generated figures and the results are stored inside the \textbf{results$/$generated} folder.

To activate the GUI first run the file \textbf{initialize.m} and then one of the following commands:
\begin{itemize}
	\item browse\_set(1,0): the full (i.e. non-segmented) trajectories.
	\item browse\_set(2,0): segmented swimming paths without any reference configuration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generating the paper's results}

The scripts in the \textbf{results$/$mwm} folder are used to generate the results and figures of the published paper, including the supplementary material. Refer to table 1 for a complete synopsis of each script's generated result as well as its connection to the paper.

Before running any of the scripts it is mandatory to run the script \textbf{initialize.m} which is located inside the home folder (\textbf{mwm-ml-master$/$}). This script loads the WEKA library (for more information refer to ``1.4 Two-stage clustering algorithm'' description of the supplementary material of the publication), the Morris water maze configurations and adds to MATLAB path the appropriate folders.

Note that the results generated by running the scripts may have differences compared to the ones in the paper. For more information on this issue please refer to section ``Differences between current code results and paper''.

\end{table}

\subsection{Using the GUI}

The GUI (figure \ref{gui}) can be used to label path segments, cluster the data and visualize the clustering results.

To activate the GUI first the script \textbf{initialize.m} which is located inside the home folder (\textbf{mwm-ml-master$\textbf{/}$}) needs to run. This script loads the WEKA library (for more information refer to ``1.4 Two-stage clustering algorithm description'' of the supplementary material of the publication), the Morris water maze configurations and adds to MATLAB path the appropriate folders. Afterwards the GUI can be activated by running any of the commands below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item browse\_set(1,0): loads the full (i.e. non-segmented) trajectories.
	\item browse\_set(2,0): loads the segmented swimming paths without any reference configuration.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{gui.jpg}\\
		\caption [gui]{Graphical user interface.}\label{gui}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent\textbf{Labels:}

Multiple labels or tags (shown to the right of each path) can be defined per trajectory. Tags are automatically saved to a file defined in the configuration file; to change the output file name where the tags are saved and define new tags (among other things) please refer to the next Section.
\\
\\
\noindent\textbf{Changing the visualization:}

The default 2x2 view layout can be changed by selecting a different number of X and Y views in the bottom right control group in the GUI. There, the main visualization and up to 2 secondary ones can also be selected (these are experiment dependent and defined in the main configuration file).
\\
\\
\noindent\textbf{Filtering and sorting segments:}

Group of segments fulfilling certain criteria (e.g. all segments that are tagged/non-tagged or which belong to a certain cluster or class) can be selected by using the group of controls found in the bottom left. Segments can also be sorted according to a specific feature or, for example, according to their distance to the cluster centroids (useful for identifying edge cases of segments falling between two behavioural classes).
\\
\\
\\
\textbf{Running the clustering algorithm:}

The clustering algorithm can be run by clicking in the 'cluster' button. Before doing so it is necessary to select a target number of clusters (done also directly in the GUI). After running, the clustering results will be automatically shown; segments of specific classes or that were wrongly classified (available if the “cross-validation” option is active) can be selected by using the filtering options.


\section{Input Data Description}

The folder \textbf{data$/$mwm\_peripubertal\_stress} contains the original Morris Water Maze trajectories of rats induced to peri-pubertal stress (PPS). The data was acquired from the Laboratory of Behavioural Genetics, EPFL. For more information about the experiments see \href{http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14562}{Gehring et al., 2015}.

Trajectories were acquired with Ethovision 3.1. A total of 3 experiments were performed, which are split into three folders: set1, set2, and set3. Specific details of each trial separately may be found inside the CSV files of the three above folders.

The data provided by the Laboratory of Behavioral Genetics needs to be calibrated. Details of the calibration are given in the supplementary information of \href{http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14562}{Gehring et al., 2015}. A ready to use calibration procedure is given in the \textbf{import$/$noldus$/$calibration$/$} directory in the root folder.  For this procedure screenshots of the trajectories need to be provided. These screenshots are the PNG files inside the screenshots folder.

Finally inside the data folder the segment\_labels and the labels\_full .csv files contain labelling data of specific trajectories for the classification process. Starting from the first column each column represents the following: experimental set, day, track, off, length and the rest are labels.

For more information about the experiment properties (platform position, radius, etc) and the data (animal groups, ids, etc) refer to the \textbf{config$/$morris\_water\_maze$/$config\_mwm.m}


\section{Code Adaptation}

In order to adapt the code to other experiments please refer to this \href{https://github.com/RodentDataAnalytics/roda}{link}, which redirects to a generalized and updated version of the code. The updated version has an improved graphical user interface and a complete description on how the code may be used with user defined experimental setups and data.


\section{Requirements}

This code requires the statistics and machine learning toolbox in addition to MATLAB itself.
It is tested and working with MATLAB versions 2013, 2014a, 2015b.


\section{Known Issues}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The function results\_strategies\_individual\_evolution.m which generates the published paper's figure 4 on page 7 cannot be generated on MATLAB version 2014b and later.
	\item The generated results may contain some dissimilarity to the ones in the paper. This difference is only quantitative and is caused because fewer labels were used during the classification process when the paper was written. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Differences between current code results and paper}
The user should note that there are differences between the software's results and the results of the published paper. These changes are only quantitative and are caused due to improving the labelling quality of the data after the paper was published. Nevertheless, the results and the conclusions remain qualitatively the same.

Below there is a list of the exact results that this software produces by running the scripts inside the \textbf{results$/$mwm} folder.\\

\end{figure}
\item \textbf{results\_strategies\_individual\_evolution.m}\\
(paper page 7, figure 4)\\
The first figure refers to the controlled group while the second to the stressed group. Note that in the paper only 12 animals from each group were selected. Also the ``Direct Finding'' strategy (which means that the animal managed to find the platform directly) was removed from the paper.

\section{In-depth Code Explanation}

\subsection{Configurations}
Inside the \textbf{config} folder are the configuration files of the software.

The \textbf{base\_config.m} is used as the base configuration upon which other configuration files for specific experiments and experimental setups can be build. The \textbf{config\_mwm.m} contains the configurations of the specific Morris Water Maze experimental setup which was used for the publication of \href{http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14562}{Gehring et al., 2015}.

As mentioned in the Code Adaptation section, the current code is linked to the specific Morris Water Maze setup described in the publication above. Thus, in order to adapt the code to other experiments please refer to this \href{https://github.com/RodentDataAnalytics/roda}{link}

\subsection{Data Representation}
The scripts inside the folder \textbf{data\_representation} among with trajectory\_simplify\_implementation.m are called to compute values along the trajectories (e.g. speed) or to change the coordinate system.

\subsection{Utility}
The \textbf{utility} folder contains scripts for the generation of hash values. Hash values are used throughout the code and assigned to trajectories, segments of trajectories, classification process, etc in order to boost the running speed of the software.

\subsection{The Noldus Functions}

\textbf{import$/$noldus$/$}\linebreak
\tab load\_calibration\_data.m\linebreak
\tab load\_trajectories.m\linebreak
\textbf{\tab calibration$/$}\linebreak
\tab\tab calibrate\_trajectory.m\linebreak
\tab\tab read\_ethovision.m\linebreak
\tab\tab read\_trajectory.m\linebreak
\tab\tab trajectory\_calibration\_data.m\linebreak
\tab\tab trajectory\_points\_from\_snapshots.m\linebreak
\tab\tab trajectory\_snapshot\_position.m\linebreak

The Noldus functions inside the import folder are responsible for parsing various information from CSV data files, created by Ethovision 3.1. The collaboration of these function is shown in figure \ref{noldus}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{noldus.jpg}\\
		\caption [noldus]{Noldus flowchart.}\label{noldus}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item\textbf{load\_trajectories.m:}
	 Imports trajectories from set(1...N) folders inside \textit{data$/$mwm\_peripubertal\_stress$/$}
	\item\textbf{load\_calibration\_data.m:}
	 Loads calibrated data if available else calibrates raw data and load them.
	\item\textbf{trajectory\_points\_from\_snapshots:}
	 Processes a directory with a series of trajectory snapshots. Returns a list of time and coordinates for this trajectory.
	\item\textbf{trajectory\_snapshot\_position:}
	 Extracts position from snapshots located inside  \textit{data$/$mwm\_peripubertal\_stress$/$screenshots$/$set(1...N)$/$}
	\item\textbf{read\_trajectory.m:}
	 Parses various information about the animals and their trajectories. Calls \textbf{read\_ethovision.m} which reads a trajectory from a CSV data file created by Ethovision 3.1.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The features Scripts}
The folder \textbf{features} contains scripts for the calculation of the segments' features. For more information about each feature refer to the main paper, page 10, section ``Methods''.

\subsection{The Graphical User Interface}
The 'gui' folder contains the code which builds the graphical user interface. As the GUI is used mainly for visualisation purposes, the reader may refer to the section Result Files for a complete review of the background processes.

\subsection{Results}
Inside the \textbf{results$/$mwm} folder there are scripts that generate the results and figures of the publication \href{http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14562}{Gehring et al., 2015}. The flowchart of each of these files can be found in the subsections below. Note the \textbf{export\_figure.m} is only used for exporting the generated figures and does not generate any results. 

The results of the scripts are stored inside the \textbf{results$/$generated} folder. The already generated file \textbf{calibration\_data\_123.mat} contains the correct trajectories after the calibration process.

Running the various result scripts will lead to the generation of the \textbf{cache} folder which will contain the files \textbf{features\_values.mat} and \textbf{trajectories\_\%id.mat}. The first file contains the calculated features and the second one all the trajectories (\%id refers to a unique generated number, for this program the generated one is 1147731521). 

\subsubsection{results\_control\_stress\_speed\_latency.m}
Comparison of full trajectory metrics for two groups of animals over a set of 12 trials (produces: paper page 3, figure 1).
